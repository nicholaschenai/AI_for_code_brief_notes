### Combining Contexts from Multiple Sources for Documentation-Specific Code Example Generation 
[[Code](https://github.com/disa-lab/AutomaticCodeExample_SANER23)]
[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14542)]
- example generation for documentation by prompting gpt3
- 40 examples on scikit learn, small sample size
- incorporation of error logs (produced by the compiler while executing a failed code example) in the input further improves the passability from 72.5% (base) to 87.5%
